# Digits Classification using Random Forest Classifier

This project aims to classify handwritten digits using a random forest classifier algorithm. By analyzing the provided dataset of handwritten digits, the model can accurately predict the digit represented in the image.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build and train the random forest classifier model for digits classification.

## Features

- Random Forest Classifier: The project utilizes the random forest classifier algorithm, a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, to classify handwritten digits.
- Feature Extraction: The dataset of handwritten digits is preprocessed and features are extracted to ensure optimal performance of the model.
- Model Training and Evaluation: The random forest classifier model is trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
- Model Testing: The trained model is then used to classify new, unseen images of handwritten digits.
- Model Deployment: The trained model can be deployed in a production environment or integrated into an application to classify handwritten digits based on input images.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for building and training the random forest classifier model.
- Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library in Python used for implementing the random forest classifier algorithm and performing model evaluation.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computations used for handling and manipulating numerical data.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library used for data visualization and creating graphical representations of the model's performance.
